# mithril-kata

Mithril version used: 1.1.6

To try these katas out clone repository to a folder on your local machine. In command line interface go into the folder of the feature you want to test and type
- *npm install* -- to install package dependecies
- *npm start* -- to run code

In windows somthing like `C:\code\mithril-kata\kata_090_partial_views>npm start`

Most (if not all) of the samples will open an html-page in browser-sync. Again, most of the samples use webpack.

The samples in this repositories rely heavily on the following packages:
* browser-sync
* webpack
* babel
* mithril

The samples were built as I was learning a about Mithril development.
